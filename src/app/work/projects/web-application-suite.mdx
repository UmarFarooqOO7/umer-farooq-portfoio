## Overview

During my tenure at IT Pro Miami, I designed and delivered multiple production web applications serving distinct business needs. Each application was built end-to-end — from database schema design through to front-end UI — using a consistent PHP/Laravel + Vue.js/React stack.

## Applications Delivered

### Events Management System
A full-featured platform for creating, managing, and tracking events. Included attendee registration, ticketing workflows, schedule management, and reporting dashboards for event organizers.

### Car Rental System
A booking and fleet management platform enabling customers to reserve vehicles and staff to manage availability, pricing, maintenance schedules, and rental history.

### Smart Cards Management System
A system for issuing, managing, and tracking smart card assets across an organization. Supported card lifecycle management, access control integration, and audit logging.

### Submission Portal
A structured intake and workflow system for managing submissions, routing them through configurable review and approval stages, with status tracking and notifications.

### Personal Finance Management System
A multi-user personal finance tracker with account aggregation, transaction categorization, budget planning, and spending analytics.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP & Laravel**: RESTful API design, business logic, and queue-based background jobs.
- **Vue.js & Livewire**: Reactive front-end components and real-time UI updates.
- **ReactJs**: Used for select applications requiring richer client-side interactivity.
- **MySQL**: Relational data modeling and query optimization for each application's domain.
- **Filament PHP**: Admin panels and back-office management interfaces.
- **Google Cloud APIs**: Cloud storage, authentication, and extended platform features.
- **JIRA & GitHub**: Sprint management, code reviews, and version control.

## Team Leadership

Across these projects I led a team of 10 developers, managing sprint planning and task allocation in JIRA, conducting code reviews to maintain quality standards, and mentoring junior developers on Laravel best practices and testing methodologies.

## Outcome

Each application was successfully delivered and deployed to production, replacing manual workflows and improving operational efficiency across their respective domains. The consistent tech stack and shared component patterns across projects allowed the team to iterate faster on each subsequent application.
