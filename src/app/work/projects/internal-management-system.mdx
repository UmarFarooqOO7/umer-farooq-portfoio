## Overview

At IT Pro Miami, I led the design and development of a high-usage internal management system from scratch. The platform was built to handle the company's core operational data, scaling to serve over 10 million data rows with fast query response times and a smooth user experience for internal staff.

## Key Features

- **Scalable Data Architecture**: Designed a normalized MySQL schema capable of handling 10M+ rows with proper indexing, query optimization, and pagination strategies to keep response times low.
- **Full-Stack Implementation**: Built the back-end API layer using PHP and Laravel, and the front-end using Vue.js and Livewire for reactive, real-time UI updates without full page reloads.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implemented a fine-grained permissions system using Filament PHP to manage different user roles and their access levels across the platform.
- **Admin Panel**: Developed a rich admin interface with Filament PHP, providing data tables, filters, bulk actions, and export capabilities for operational teams.
- **Google Cloud Integration**: Integrated Google Cloud APIs to enable cloud-based file storage, processing, and other extended platform capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP & Laravel**: Core back-end framework for business logic, API endpoints, and queue processing.
- **Vue.js & Livewire**: Front-end interactivity and reactive components.
- **MySQL**: Primary relational database with optimized indexing for large-scale data.
- **Filament PHP**: Admin panel and RBAC management.
- **Google Cloud APIs**: Cloud storage and extended functionality.
- **GitHub & JIRA**: Version control and project/sprint management.

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was maintaining acceptable performance as the dataset grew beyond millions of rows. This required careful query planning, use of database indexes, and caching strategies. Another challenge was building a UI that remained responsive and intuitive for non-technical internal users while exposing the full complexity of the data underneath.

## Outcome

The system became a central operational tool used daily across the organization, replacing a fragmented set of spreadsheets and manual processes. It significantly reduced reporting time, improved data accuracy, and gave management real-time visibility into business operations.
