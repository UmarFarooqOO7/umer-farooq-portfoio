## Overview

At Accrisoft Corporation (US, Remote), I joined an ongoing effort to maintain and modernize a legacy enterprise software platform originally built in 1995. The platform spans 2+ million lines of PHP code across 100+ modules and serves a large base of enterprise clients. The primary goal was to consolidate and modernize the codebase to improve performance, maintainability, and developer experience.

## Key Features

- **Module Consolidation**: Participated in a major consolidation initiative that reduced 100+ legacy modules down to 15 focused modules, cutting the total codebase by 65%.
- **Performance Gains**: The consolidation and modernization effort resulted in a 2X improvement in overall application performance.
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Leveraged AI-assisted development tools — specifically Cursor and Claude Code — to accelerate code analysis, splitting, and modernization tasks that would otherwise take significantly longer manually.
- **Test Coverage**: Wrote unit and integration tests across modernized modules to ensure code reliability and prevent regression bugs introduced during refactoring.
- **CI/CD Participation**: Collaborated in CI/CD pipelines and release management processes to ensure safe, incremental deployments across the enterprise client base.
- **Production Support**: Troubleshot and resolved production issues across both legacy and modernized parts of the system.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Primary language across the entire platform.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated build, test, and deployment workflows.
- **Unit & Integration Testing**: PHPUnit-based test suites for reliability.
- **Cursor & Claude Code**: AI-assisted development tools for code analysis and modernization.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaborative code review workflows.

## Challenges and Learnings

Working with 30 years of accumulated code presented unique challenges — undocumented business logic, deeply coupled modules, and inconsistent coding patterns across decades of contributors. The biggest learning was how to approach legacy systems with respect: understanding before changing, testing before deploying, and using AI tools intelligently to accelerate analysis without introducing new bugs.

## Outcome

The module reduction from 100+ to 15 delivered a measurable 65% reduction in codebase complexity and a 2X improvement in application speed. The modernized platform is now significantly easier to maintain, extend, and onboard new developers into — setting the foundation for continued product growth.
